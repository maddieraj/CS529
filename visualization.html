    Description
   </h3>
   <p>The visualization image here forecasts the estimated cost of using different household appliance for the period October 2022 to January 2023.
    The vertical line represents the runtime of the appliance in hours, rectangle represents the category the appliance belongs to and circle represents the cost in euros.
    What I like about this visualization is that the size of the circle gives how little or huge the cost is. So, even if the image is viewed in greyscale, we can easily differentiate the cost among the appliances.
    We can quickly learn from the image that 'Gas central heating' will lead to a higher bill cost due to it's obvious difference in size compared to others.
    The contrast to the foreground and background is well applied, and the text is easily readable.
    Another thing is that, each category has different colors which helps us to distinguish the the category that the appliance belongs to.
    I like how minimalist this visual representation is while giving useful information in the form of different shapes and sizes.
