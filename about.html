        <h3>Black Hat - </h3>
        <p>
            For the black hat visualization, I did the plotting of the overall distribution of deaths as points to mislead the visualization.<br>
            The map does not tell us about the overall death in a state as we cannot possibly count the number of dots. <br>
            Also, using the same color for both the genders does not provide us information about their split in number of victims. <br>
            Visually, if you look at the map, there seems to be more number of points in the east coast, so I chose a misleading title to make it black hat visualization.
        </p>
        <h3>White - </h3>
        <p>
            The white hat visualization is improved with chloropleth map with gradient coloring ranging from light to dark blue to indicate the number of victims..<br>
            Lighter shade has less number of death and increases with saturation. <br>
            Hovering over the map will let us know about the overall death as well as the deaths based on the gender. <br>
            Additionally, clicking on a state will display a break down with city wise deaths segregating them based on their age.
