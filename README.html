    Hi!
   </h3>
   <p>My name is Madhumitha Rajarajan. I am a second year Computer Science graduate student.
    I hail from Chennai, India and I moved to Chicago in Fall 2021. Prior to my Masters, I was working at Cognizant as a Programmer Analyst in banking sector.
    Data Science is a field that piques my interest and I have always enjoyed playing with data. So, I decided to pursue Masters' to expand my horizon in this field.
    The reason why I took this course was because Visualization in Data Science is something new to me and I wanted to delve deeper to have a better understanding in this domain.
    Since effective visual representation helps in better understanding of the data, Visual Data Science will play a major role in any Data related roles.</p>
    
    <p>Apart from studies, I love to cook and inadvertently discover new recipes while doing so.
    I binge watch on shows when I have free time. My favorite genres are rom-com and mystery and I absolutely hate horror.
    I recently discovered that I'm a nature lover and I enjoy going on hikes.
    I have always loved watching sunsets and listening to the sound of beach waves and rain.
