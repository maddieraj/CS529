        <h2> About this project </h2>
        <p> Although this map shows the distributions of the death across the map for each state, it is deceptive in following ways: <br>
        

            First, the higher number of victims are in California, but looking at this map, it misleads us into thinking the more number of deaths in somewhere in east coast.  </br>
            Second, female and male markers have the same color which makes it hard to distinguish between them. <br>
            Third, merely plotting the points does not tell us anything about the overall death in that state. <br>
            Finally, the title is a bit misleading as we have no information on the total number of deaths to prove it.
